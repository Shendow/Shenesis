A classic server list modification for PAYDAY 2.
By classic I mean that the design is inspired by PAYDAY: THE HEIST's server list.

How do I install it?
========

Download these files (besides LICENSE and README.md), and drop them in your PAYDAY 2 game directory.
You will also need IPHLAPI.dll, which is what allows this mod and other lua mods to work. At the moment I can't add it to the repository somehow.

If you are asked to overwrite PD2Hook.yml, I recommend you check your game's PD2Hook.yml file and the mod's. Overwriting it would disable all other lua scripts that you may have running.

Info you need to know
========

This is EXPERIMENTAL. You may crash or it may look weird on some resolutions. If you find any problem related to this mod, please send me an e-mail (shenesis(at)gmail.com).
I recommend you make a backup of your save before installing this mod - Here's a link showing you how: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=170416480
